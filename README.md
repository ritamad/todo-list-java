## ToDo List (Java Console App)

This is a basic ToDo List application built in Java, currently running via console.  
It was developed as a personal learning project to practice core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, collections, and basic input/output handling.

The goal is to incrementally evolve this app by adding more advanced features over time, such as:

- A graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing
- Persistent storage with files (JSON, CSV,..)
- Integration with a relational database
- User authentication (login system)

This step-by-step upgrade path allows me to progressively improve my skills in Java development, software architecture, and real-world project structuring.
